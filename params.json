You will also need a Trello API key,\r\nwhich you can easily generate from [here](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"emrello.js\" data-emrello-key=\"{app key}\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nTrello lets you embed cards and boards in your page like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- embed as image -->\r\n<img src=\"https://trello.com/c/ShRTNamE.png\" /><!-- a card -->\r\n<img src=\"https://trello.com/b/sHRtNaMe.png\" /><!-- a board -->\r\n\r\n<!-- embed as a JavaScript that renders the object by document.write -->\r\n<script src=\"https://trello.com/c/ShRTNamE.js\"></script><!-- a card -->\r\n<script src=\"https://trello.com/b/sHRtNaMe.js\"></script><!-- a board -->\r\n\r\n<!-- using an iframe -->\r\n<iframe src=\"https://trello.com/c/ShRTNamE.html\"></iframe><!-- a card -->\r\n<iframe src=\"https://trello.com/b/sHRtNaMe.html\"></iframe><!-- a board -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese methods get you a static card or board, and would not get updated with\r\nrealtime changes (These files are generated every few minutes though). If you\r\nwant to update your embedded Trello object more often than that, you need to\r\nuse **Emrello.js**.\r\n\r\nWith **Emrello.js** you get the ability to embed lists as well.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nEmrello.js is still at alpha stage. It has to have a lot more things before\r\nit can ever be used in production. Your contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\nHead over to [Emrello.js's Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vUMIXgBw). You\r\nwill finds some things that need immediate attention in \"Bugs\" and \"Features\r\nto be added\" lists.\r\n\r\nKindly send all your pull requests to `dev` branch.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
